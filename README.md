### Branching and Merging in GitHub

**Branches in GitHub:**
Branches are separate lines of development in a Git repository. They allow developers to work on features, fixes, or experiments independently from the main codebase. This isolation helps prevent conflicts and enables parallel development.

**Importance of Branches:**
- **Isolation:** Changes in one branch do not affect others.
- **Collaboration:** Multiple developers can work on different features simultaneously.
- **Testing:** Experiment and test features without risking the main codebase.

**Process of Creating a Branch, Making Changes, and Merging:**

1. **Create a Branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```
   This command creates a new branch named `feature-branch` and switches to it.

2. **Make Changes:**
   - Edit files and commit your changes.
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new feature"
   ```

3. **Push the Branch to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch
   ```

4. **Create a Pull Request:**
   - On GitHub, navigate to the repository and create a pull request to merge `feature-branch` into the main branch.

5. **Merge the Branch:**
   - After code review and approval, merge the pull request.
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git merge feature-branch
   ```

6. **Delete the Branch (Optional):**
   ```bash
   git branch -d feature-branch
   ```


# Pull Requests and Code Reviews:
What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration? Outline the steps to create and review a pull request.
    


**Pull Request in GitHub:**
A pull request (PR) is a method for submitting contributions to a project. It lets you notify team members about changes you've pushed to a GitHub repository. PRs facilitate collaboration by enabling code reviews, discussions, and approval processes before merging changes into the main branch.

**How Pull Requests Facilitate Code Reviews and Collaboration:**
- **Code Review:** Team members can review the code, provide feedback, and request changes.
